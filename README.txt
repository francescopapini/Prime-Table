To run the code simply add a number after the executable. For example:
"main.rb 10" will generate a 10 row table.

If no number or more than one number is added, a message asking to insert one number only will appear. 

I have put all my methods under one class only (see prime_number.rb), as i thought it was enough for the complexity of the exercise.

I have used rspec to test each single method (in the file prime_number_spec.rb).

For the table's layout, i have used the terminal-table library.
